            <h1>FHow is Computer Science Different from IT?</h1>
            <h3 id="cohort">Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. It involves working with
            mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory. Computer scientists define the
            computational principles that are the basis of all software.
            
            Information technology (IT) focuses on the development, implementation, support, and management of computers and
            information systems. IT involves working both with hardware (CPUs, RAM, hard disks) and software (operating systems, web
            browsers, mobile applications). IT professionals make sure that computers, networks, and systems work well for all users</h3>
